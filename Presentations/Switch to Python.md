Transcript:
(00:03) I had a very difficult and in my own head Brave leap that I had to take relevant to our discussion which is most of my life I programmed in C and C plus plus and so uh having that hammer everything looked like a nail so I would literally even do scripting in C plus plus like I would create programs that do script like things and uh when I first came to Google and and before then it became already before tensorflow before all of that there was a growing realization that c plus is not the right tool for machine learning we could talk about why that is it's unclear why that is a lot of things has to do with community and culture and
(00:47) how it emerges and stuff like that but for me they decided to take the leap to python like all out basically switched completely from C plus plus except for a highly performant robotics applications there were still uh there's still a culture of C plus plus in in the space of robotics that was a big leap like I had to you know like like people have like existential crises or midlife crises or whatever you have to realize almost like walking away from uh from a person you love um because I was sure that c plus would have to be a lifelong companion for a lot of problems I would want to solve C plus would be there and it was a
(01:28) question to say well that might not be the case because sibo spots is still one of the most popular languages in the world one of the most used one of the most dependent on it's also still evolving quite a bit I mean that that is not a sort of fossilizing Community yes they they are doing great Innovative work actually a lot but yet that sort of their Innovations are hard to follow if you're not already a hardcore C plus plus user well this was the thing it pulls you in it's a rabbit hole I was a hardcore the all meta programming template programming like I I would start using the modern C plus as it developed right
(02:09) not just the not just the shared pointer and the garbage collection that makes it easier for you to work with some of the flaws but the detail like The Meta programming the the crazy stuff that's that's coming out there but then you have to just empirically look and step back and say what language am I more productive in sorry to say what language do I enjoy my life with more and uh readability and able to think through and all that kind of stuff that those questions are harder to ask when you already have a loved one which in my case was C plus plus and then there's python uh like that Meme was is the the grass is
(02:53) greener on the other side am I just infatuated with a new fad new cool thing or is this actually going to make my life better and I think a lot of people face that kind of decision it was a difficult decision for me um when I made it at this time it's an obvious switch if you're into machine learning but at that time it wasn't quite yet so obvious so it was a risk and you know you have the same kind of stuff with um I still because of my connection to Wordpress I still do a lot of back-end programming in PHP uh and the question is you know node.
(03:30) js python do you switch to do you switch back into any of those programming there's the case for node.js for me well more and more and more of the front end it runs in JavaScript um and fascinating cool stuff is on his JavaScript maybe use the same programming language for the back end as well uh the case for python for the back end is well you're doing so much programming outside of the web in Python so maybe use Python for the back end and then the case for PHP well most of the web still runs in PHP you have a lot of experience with PHP why uh fix something that's not broken those are my own personal struggles but
(04:13) I think they reflect the struggles of a lot of people and with different programming languages with different problems they're trying to solve it's a weird one and there there's not a single answer right because depending on how much time you have to learn new stuff where you are in your life what what you're currently working on who you want to work with what communities you like yeah there's not one right choice maybe if you if you sort of if you can look back 20 years you can say well that whole detour through action script was a waste of time but nobody could know that so you can you can beat yourself up over
(04:56) that uh you just need to accept that not every choice you make is going to be perfect maybe sort of keep Plan B in the back of your mind uh but don't don't overthink it don't don't try to sort of don't don't create a spreadsheet with like where you're trying to estimate well if I learn this language I expect to make x million dollars in a lifetime and if I learn that language I expect to make why a million dollars in a lifetime and which Which is higher and what which has more risk and where's the chance that it's like picking picking a stock kind of kind of but uh I think with stocks you can do
(05:50) diversifying your investment is good with productivity in life boy that spreadsheet is possible to construct like if you actually carefully analyze what your interest in life are where you think you can maximally impact the world there really is better and worse choices for a programming language they're not just about the syntax but about the community about where you predict the community's headed what large systems are programmed in that but can you create that spreadsheet because that sort of you're mentioning a whole bunch of inputs that go into that spreadsheet where you have to estimate things that are very hard to measure and
(06:32) even harder I mean they're they're hard to measure retroactively and they're even harder to predict like what is the better community well better is is one of those incredibly difficult words what's better for you is not better for someone else no but we're not doing a public speech about what's better we're doing a personal spiritual journey I can determine a circle of friends circle circle one and circle two and I can have a bunch of parties with one and a bunch of parties with two and then right down or to take a mental note of what made me happier right and that you know you have if you're a machine
(07:13) learning person you want to say Okay I want to build a large company that does that is grounded in machine learning but also has a sexy interface that has a large impact on the world what languages do I use you look at what Facebook is using you look at what Twitter is using then you look at performance more newer languages like rust or you look at languages that have taken that most the community uses in the machine learning space that's Python and you can like think through you can hang out and think through it and it's it's always a invest and the the level of activity of the community is also really interesting
(07:50) like you said c plus and python are super active in terms of the development of the language itself but do you think that you can make objective choices there no no well but there's a gut you build up like don't you don't you believe in that gut feeling everything is very subjective and yes you most certainly can have a gut feeling and your gut can also be wrong that's why there are billions of people because they're not all right I mean clearly there are more people living in the Bay Area who have plans to sort of create a Google sized company then there's room in the world for Google sized companies and they're gonna
(08:31) have to Duke it out in the market the space and there's many more choices than just the programming language
